# Quick 002 - Walkers
   Started by wanting to put together a quick framework for building art using walkers.  
   
   For the first iteration just some basic walkers that walk 1px in a random direction, or stand still, each frame.  As they do they leave a trail of colour.
   
   I plan to revisit this one with new types of walkers.  Different types of motion, different effects on the image... that sort of thing.
