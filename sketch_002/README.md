# Sketch 002 - Truchet Tiles 
   Experimenting with the use of tiles to create interesting geometry.  The tiles are placed in a grid and rotated.  The final pieces that this method can generate depend on the properties of the tiles used.
   
   I've also added square subdivision, so that as the tiles are generated, there's a random chance that a tile will be subdivided into four new tiles that fill the same space.  This allows for different scales of detail in the final piece.
